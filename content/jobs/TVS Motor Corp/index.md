- Developed a real-time dashboard interface, using {Flask}, {React}, and {SQL} integrated with Deep Learning Modules and Camera Modules to visualise and examine motor-cycle fragments stratification work-flow.
- Engineered an employee interface to supervise industrial machinery to continuously study and inspect metrics in order to record various operations performed in parallel using {Django}, {React}, and {SQL} in the workplace.
- Orchestrated my fellow colleagues to work on very sensitive backend code where a value modification in machine directs to a change of state of other machines.
- Worked in a large team with excellent communication skills which helped me convey my thought process and ideas clearly and helped the team's productivity to go up by 150%.
