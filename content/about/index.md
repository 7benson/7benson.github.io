Hi there! I'm Jayanth Kumar, and I thrive on crafting real-time projects that not only exist on the internet but also serve the needs of people. I am particularly excited about delving deeper into the industrial sector to acquire valuable skills and gain insights into the evolving expectations from developers in the real world.

Fast-forwarding to the present day, I have been fortunate to contribute my expertise to three major corporations - [Texas Instruments](https://ti.com/), [Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/en/), [TVS Motor Corp](https://www.tvsmotor.com/) - and an innovative startup called [Survey Buddy](https://www.surveybuddy.net/). My current focus revolves around tackling real-world software engineering challenges that contribute to shaping a better future every single day.

A few Tech Stacks I love working with,
