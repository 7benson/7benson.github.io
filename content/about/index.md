Hi! My name is Jayanth Kumar and I enjoy creating realtime projects that serve people and live on the internet. 
I am looking forward to work more on the Industrial side to gain skills and understand what the World expects from Developers .
 
Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at
[a start-up]("https://www.surveybuddy.in/"),and
[a huge corporation]("https://www.tvsmotor.com/"). My
predominant consciousness nowadays is constructing Virtual Reality Apps for the betterment of every day closer to the future.
