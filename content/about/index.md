Hi! My name is Jayanth Kumar and I enjoy creating realtime projects that serve people and live on the internet. 
I am looking forward to work more on the Industrial side to gain skills and understand what the World expects from Developers .
 
Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at
2 huge corporations [TVS Motor Corp]("https://www.tvsmotor.com/") and [Texas Instruments]("https://www.ti.com/") and 
at a start-up [Survey Buddy]("https://www.surveybuddy.in/"). My
predominant consciousness nowadays is solving real-life software engineering problem statements for the betterment of every day closer to the future.

A few Tech Stacks i love working with,
